The classic puzzle game built for the browser with React.js

###[Play Now!][minesweeper]

##Details:
* Clicking a tile either explodes it or reveals it and recursively reveals any safe neighbors
* Clicking while holding the alt key flags tiles as unsafe
* Object Oriented design for board and tile logic
* Performance enhanced by caching tile's neighbors and neighboring bomb count
* Random bomb placement achieved with a custom array sampling method
* Renders Tile components with classes (for CSS styling) based on tile's state and bomb count
* Renders Tiles with inline styling for animation on winning or losing
